# Fundamentals-of-Computer-Vision
Contains projects related to Computer Vision, completed as part of academic coursework activities in the related course at the University of Tehran.
There are some small image processing projects that we did for the course. Also, there is the main project named [Air Piano](https://github.com/umar07/Air-Paino/tree/main) that recognizes hand movements and plays piano accordingly. Also it has some features like volume changer. We used the source code and changed some parts to add a sound mixer to it.
