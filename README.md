Contains projects related to computer vision and image processing, completed as part of academic coursework activities at the University of Tehran.
This repository contains some small image processing projects, and there is the main project named [Air Piano](https://github.com/umar07/Air-Paino/tree/main). 
Air piano recognizes hand movements and plays piano accordingly. In addition, it has some features like volume changer. We used the source code and changed some parts to add a sound mixer to it.
